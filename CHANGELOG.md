# [Unreleased][] (master)

* Your contribution here!
* Add `bundle_task_ssh_kit_options` option to configure SSHKit options

# [1.2.0][] (1 Oct 2016)

Breaking changes

* None

Added

* A `bundle clean` task.  There are no default hooks for it.
* Use `bundle check` to check if we can skip `bundle install`
* Run `bundle:install` on rollback (`deploy:reverted`)
* You can now `require "capistrano/bundler/tasks"` to load the tasks only without the hooks

# 1.1.4 (22 Jan 2015)

* Donâ€™t generate binstubs by default (#61)

# 1.1.3 (4 Aug 2014)

* Honor `:no_release` flag by using `release_roles` in Capistrano 3.1
* capistrano-bundler now requires Capistrano 3.1 or higher (~> 3.1)
* Added `:bundle_jobs` option for specifying number of parallel jobs

# 1.1.2 (8 Feb 2014)

* Added `bundle_env_variables` option for specifying environment variables that should be set when running `bundle`.
* The `bundle_dir` option is now named `bundle_path`
* Use `bundle install` instead of `bundle`
* All options are now optional and can be excluded from the final bundle command by setting them to `nil`
* Bundler looks for a `Gemfile` by default, so there is no need to specify it.

# 1.1.1

* ruby is not prefixed with `bundle exec` anymore by default
* prefix rails with `bundle exec` by default

# 1.1.0

* Switching to new command map (https://github.com/capistrano/sshkit/pull/45)
  Thanks to new command map, now this integration adds `bundle exec` to global executables (gem, ruby, rake). The list of executable can be tweaked by `bundle_bins`.
